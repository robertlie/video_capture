Convert video to bitmap images and create bmp.bin and logo.bin for Sipeed Longan Nano TFT display

For more information see tutorial [How to create bmp.bin and logo.bin files to be displayed on the Sipeed Logan Nano TFT display](https://www.mobilefish.com/developer/riscv/riscv_quickguide_create_bitmap_animation.html)

The bmp2hex.py program was copied from:<br />
[https://dl.sipeed.com/LONGAN/Nano/Firmware/badapple_demo_tools/ - Download file tools_bmp2hex.zip](https://dl.sipeed.com/LONGAN/Nano/Firmware/badapple_demo_tools/)

I have made no modification to the bmp2hex.py program.
